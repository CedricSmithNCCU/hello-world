Creating a repository to learn Pull Request workflow.

Hi, my name is Cedric T. Smith and I'm an aspiring Software Engineer. I have a great deal of leadership training and experience from my military and collegiate years. My pursuit of a degree in Computer Science and Business, and 4-years’ experience in the military has made me more than ready to work at this position and provide much professionalism. I’ve recently completed a summer Software Engineer internship with BlackRock, in New York City. I have experience developing in back-end languages such as C++ and Java. I also have experience developing on the front-end using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and D3.js. I’ve participated in several hackathons hosted by the Home Depot, The National Football League, Thurgood Marshall College Fund, and BlackRock. Currently, I am a Senior at North Carolina Central University and I am expected to graduate in May 2020 with a bachelor’s degree in Computer Science and Business.
